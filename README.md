Parallel-Contraction-Hierarchy 
====================== 

This repository includes the implmentation of parallel contaction hierarchy. 

## Developing 

### Prerequisites 
* g++ &gt;= 7 with support for Cilk Plus and C++17 (It is tested with g++ 7.5.0) 

### Setting up 
Download and unzip this repository.
Add the submodule.
```shell
cd Parallel-Contraction-Hierarchy-AEE1/ 
git clone git@github.com:cmuparlay/parlaylib.git
```

### Building
A makefile is given in the repository, you can compile the code by: 
```shell
make
```

## Usage

### Build Parallel Contraction Hierarchy
```shell
./build_pch [-i input_file_path] [-o output_file_path] [-p max_pop_count] [-s selection_fraction] [-t st_query_verify_num] [-q sssp_query_verify_num] [-d print_details] 
```
Options: 
* `-i <input_file_path>`: (Required) the path to the input file containing graph data. Feasible graphs can be found [here.](https://pasgal-bs.cs.ucr.edu/)
* `-o <output_file_path>`: the path to save the output results.
* `-p <max_pop_count>`: the maximum number of vertices to settle during the local search phase. Higher values may improve accuracy at the cost of runtime.
* `-s <selection_fraction>`: the fraction of feasible vertices to be contracted in each round. For example, 0.1 selects 10% of feasible vertices.
* `-t <st_query_verify_num>`: the number of s-t queries to verify the correctness of output CH graph.
* `-v <sssp_query_verify_num>`: the number of sssp queries to verify the correctness of output CH graph.
* `-d` print the details of each round

For example, if you want to compute the CH of a weighted graph INPUT_NAME and store the output CH graph in OUTPUT_NAME, set max_pop_count=5000, selection_fraction=1, run st query 20 times and print the per round detail during the contraction, you can run:
```shell
./build_pch -i INPUT_NAME -o OUTPUT_NAME -p 5000 -s 1 -t 20 -d
```
## Graph Formats
The application can auto-detect the format of the input graph based on the suffix of the filename. Here is a list of supported graph formats: 
+ `.bin` The binary graph format from [GBBS](https://github.com/ParAlg/gbbs). 
+ `.adj` The adjacency graph format from [Problem Based Benchmark suite](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pbbs/benchmarks/graphIO.html). 


### Query

```shell
./query [origin_graph] [ch_graph] [st_query_verify_num] [sssp_query_verify_num]
```

For example, for a origin_graph ORIGIN_GRAPH and its corresponding ch_graph CH_GRAPH, if you want to run st query 20 times and sssp query 40 times, you can run:
```shell
./query ORIGIN_GRAPH CH_GRAPH 20 40
```
